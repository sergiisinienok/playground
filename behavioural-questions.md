# Why do you want to work for XYZ (Amazon as an example)?

Thera are at least three points of why, as I see it:

1. Customer-centric

I discovered [14 Amazon Leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles) a while ago while working on the training program for our Engineering Leadership.
What I relly liked is Customer Obsession and it is really resonating to me. I believe, there's a big difference between providing a service and being willing to serve.
So, I'm always looking for the ways to put my own customer service skills to the good use. I can do this by working for Amazon and owning this honorablee responsibility of delivering valuable results.

2. People around me

From what I understand, Amazon employs the most forward thinking and intelligent people awailable. It is extremely valuable to me to be a part of a great team and constantly challenge myself to learn and grow. I believe I can commit to this culture by helping other people to evolve by shring my knowledge and experience.

3. Pushing the limits as a lifestyle

Based on what I know, Amazon is a company that continually raises the bar of innovation and breaks into new markets. I'd be very excited being a part of this culture of always looking forward towards the best service to its customers. I want to commit to this kind of culture.
